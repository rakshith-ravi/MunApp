# MunApp

This app is meant to automate the proceedings of a MUN.

This app takes care of the timing, the voting, etc.  
Most of the features needed in a small scale MUN is available.

As of now (Nov 2017), the project is dead. I don't have time to work on it anymore.  
However, if you feel like working on the project, please feel free to do so. I'd be the most happy to see that.

Open the Solution file (.sln) with Visual Studio and check out the code there to know what's going on.  

Although I made this in my school times, my code is structured well and the variables are named properly.  
So it shouldn't be an issue to pick up the code and carry it forward.  
If any problems with the code or reading it, open an issue and I'll definitely look into it.

However, that being said, if you're gonna make something like this, I'd highly recommend you to
have a clean slate and start making something with a completely different stack from scratch.  
I made a native app ages ago and that stack is now outdated (I used the ancient WinForms to make this).

So if you are gonna work on something like this, I'd recommend a stack like so:
* Web app and/or website for the admins and MUN committees. 
* An Native or Xamarin (or maybe even React Native) app for Android and iOS.
* A Node.JS backend and API server for the database part

Happy coding!
